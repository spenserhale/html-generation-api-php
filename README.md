# HTML Generation API
Painless html generation that is framework agnostic

## Credits
Heavily cloned from [Laravel-HTML](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-html)

Liked their library core; I did not like it tied to Laravel models, requests and sessions
dependencies from Laravel. This package trims out other than illuminate/support to make more compatible with other frameworks.
